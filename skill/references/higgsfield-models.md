## Prompt Optimization — 2500 Character Limit

### The Realism Formula

Every prompt MUST follow this structure within 2500 chars:

```
[SUBJECT] + [ACTION] + [ENVIRONMENT] + [LIGHTING] + [CAMERA] + [STYLE] + [DETAILS]
```

### Prompt Architecture (copy this template)

```
{descriptor} {subject} {doing what}, {environment}, {lighting description}, {camera angle/movement}, {style keywords}, {mood}, {technical quality}
```

### Realism Keywords That Work

**Photography style:**
- "shot on Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.4"
- "studio product photography"
- "editorial lifestyle photography"
- "street photography, natural light"
- "overhead flat lay, soft diffused light"

**Lighting:**
- "golden hour warm side lighting"
- "soft diffused studio light, slight rim light"
- "dramatic chiaroscuro, single key light"
- "overcast natural light, even exposure"
- "backlit with soft fill, lens flare"

**Camera:**
- "shallow depth of field, f/1.8 bokeh"
- "wide angle, low perspective, leading lines"
- "macro close-up, tack sharp focus"
- "eye-level medium shot, rule of thirds"
- "bird's eye view, symmetrical composition"

**Quality boosters:**
- "photorealistic, 8K ultra HD"
- "hyperdetailed skin texture, subsurface scattering"
- "physically accurate reflections and shadows"
- "film grain, Kodak Portra 400 color science"
- "commercial product photography, clean background"

**Mood/atmosphere:**
- "warm and inviting, cozy ambiance"
- "sleek and modern, minimal"
- "luxurious, premium feel"
- "energetic, vibrant, bold"

### Prompt Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
- Start with the subject, not the style
- Include specific camera/lens references for realism
- Mention lighting direction and quality
- Add one mood/atmosphere descriptor
- Specify material textures when visible
- Use "photorealistic" or "commercial photography" as quality anchors

**DON'T:**
- Waste chars on "a beautiful" or "a stunning" (the model knows)
- List more than 3 style keywords (diminishing returns)
- Use negative prompts in the main prompt (save for negative_prompt field)
- Repeat the same concept twice
- Use vague terms like "nice" or "good quality"

### Model-Specific Prompt Adjustments

**Z Image / Nano Banana (cheap):**
- Keep prompts SHORT (under 800 chars) — they work better with less
- Focus on subject + style, skip complex scene descriptions
- Great for iteration: generate 4-5 variants quickly

**Nano Banana 2 / Seedream 5.0 Lite:**
- Full 2500 char prompts work well
- Can handle complex multi-element scenes
- Good at following specific instructions

**Soul 2.0 / Soul Cinema:**
- Emphasize mood, aesthetic, and fashion keywords
- "editorial", "lifestyle", "magazine cover" work great
- Supports reference images for consistency

**GPT Image 2:**
- Best for text-on-image (brand names, labels)
- Handles complex compositions well
- Use for anything needing typography

**Nano Banana Pro:**
- The "thinking" model — follows logic better
- Best for hard briefs that need precision
- Great text rendering in multiple languages
